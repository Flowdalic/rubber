"""
This module supports the 'asymptote' LaTeX package.

The content of each 'asy' environment is copied into a separate .asy
file, which must then be processed by the 'asy' external tool to
produce a .eps/.pdf.  If the output already exists, it is inserted,
but a (maybe identical) .asy is created nevertheless.

The inline option may be passed with \usepackage[inline]{asymptote} or
\begin[inline]{asy}, and asks 'asy' to produce and insert TeX output
instead of .eps/.pdf. As rubber currently fails to report environment
options, only the former is recognized.

Asymptote insists on replacing the main .aux file with an empty one,
so we backup its content before running the external tool.
