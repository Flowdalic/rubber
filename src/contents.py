        A snapshot of the contents of an external file.

        The special value NO_SUCH_FILE is returned when path does not
        refer to an existing external file. However, an exception is
        raised if an existing file vanishes between two calls.

        The implementation trusts the operating system about modification
        times, and assumes that an unchanged time stamp implies unchanged
        contents. Malicious or unadvised users may change timestamps.

        Moreover, an overwrite will not be detected if it is more recent
        than the smallest interval representable by operating timestamps.

        The implementation relies on the MD5 hash to detect modified
        contents. For such a non-cryptographic use,  the probability of
        collision (2^-64) can be neglected for all practical needs.
